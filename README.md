# 🚀 Data Structures & Algorithms in C++

Welcome to my personal repository where I solve and organize a wide range of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems using **C++**. This repo reflects my journey of mastering algorithmic thinking, problem-solving, and preparing for coding interviews and competitive programming.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository is a collection of hand-picked and well-structured DSA problems that I’ve solved to strengthen my foundation in:

- Core Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, etc.)
- Algorithmic Patterns (Recursion, Backtracking, Sliding Window, etc.)
- Competitive Coding Skills (STL, Bit Manipulation, etc.)
- Efficient Problem Solving (Dynamic Programming, Binary Search, etc.)

Each problem is solved in **C++**, with code optimized for clarity, time complexity, and best practices.
