Great! Here's a complete guide to Graph Data Structure â€” everything you need to know to solve questions efficiently:

ðŸ”¹ 1. Graph Basics
Graph: A set of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.

Types of Graphs:

Directed vs Undirected

Weighted vs Unweighted

Cyclic vs Acyclic

Connected vs Disconnected

Representations:

Adjacency Matrix: 2D array; space O(VÂ²)

Adjacency List: List of lists/map; space O(V + E) â†’ most used

ðŸ”¹ 2. Graph Traversal Algorithms
Used to visit all the nodes:

âœ… BFS (Breadth-First Search)
Queue-based

Good for finding shortest path in unweighted graphs

Time: O(V + E)

âœ… DFS (Depth-First Search)
Stack/Recursion-based

Good for exploring connected components

Time: O(V + E)

ðŸ”¹ 3. Pathfinding Algorithms
âœ… Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
Weighted Graphs (no negative weights)

Priority Queue (min-heap)

Time: O(E log V)

âœ… Bellman-Ford
Works with negative weights

Time: O(VE)

Detects negative cycles

âœ… Floyd-Warshall
All-pairs shortest paths

Dynamic programming

Time: O(VÂ³)

âœ… A* Algorithm
Similar to Dijkstra + heuristic function

Used in games/pathfinding

ðŸ”¹ 4. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
âœ… Primâ€™s Algorithm
Greedy

Uses Min-Heap

Time: O(E log V)

âœ… Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm
Greedy

Uses Union-Find

Sort all edges â†’ add if they donâ€™t form a cycle

Time: O(E log E)

ðŸ”¹ 5. Cycle Detection
DFS with visited + recursion stack â†’ for Directed Graph

Union-Find â†’ for Undirected Graph

ðŸ”¹ 6. Topological Sorting
For DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)

Order of tasks

DFS-based or Kahnâ€™s Algorithm (BFS)

ðŸ”¹ 7. Strongly Connected Components (SCC)
Kosarajuâ€™s Algorithm

Tarjanâ€™s Algorithm

ðŸ”¹ 8. Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union - DSU)
Used in Kruskalâ€™s and cycle detection

With path compression and union by rank

Time: O(Î±(N)) ~ constant

ðŸ”¹ 9. Bipartite Graph Checking
Using BFS or DFS with 2-coloring

If conflict â†’ not bipartite

ðŸ”¹ 10. Advanced Topics
Bridge & Articulation Point Detection

Eulerian Path/Circuit

Hamiltonian Path

Network Flow (Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp)

ðŸ”¹ Common Graph Questions to Practice
Clone a Graph (DFS/BFS)

Detect cycle in directed/undirected graph

Number of Islands

Shortest Path in Grid

Course Schedule (Topological Sort)

Word Ladder (BFS)

Kruskalâ€™s/Primâ€™s for MST

Dijkstra/Bellman-Ford in weighted graphs

Bipartite Graph Check
